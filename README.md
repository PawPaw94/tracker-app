# tracker-app

A simple task-tracker app which uses a local server based on JSON server (https://github.com/typicode/json-server). 
Goal was to train react skills such as: 
-componentes 
-useState
-useEffect
-controlled components
-routing,
-async functions. 

Hosted on heroku without the server function (cannot add tasks). App needs to be run locally.
